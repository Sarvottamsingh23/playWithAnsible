We have create here mainplaybook named playbook_include.yml(for understanding include module)
it consists of 4 tasks:
 1st task will install apache2
 2nd task will check for directory and it will say directory is empty.
 in 3rd step we will create a directory
 in 4th step it will show directory is not empty as we have created in previous step.

 Now we will run nginx.yaml seperately.
